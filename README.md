# Markdown Tutorial

## Italics and Bold
To make a phrase _italic_ in Markdown, you can surround words with and underscore ( _ ).

To make a phrase **bold** in Markdown, you can surround words with two asterisks ( ** ).

You can use both italics and bold in the **_same_** line. You can also span them **_across multiple words_**.

## Headers
To make headers in Markdown, you preface the phrase with a has mark ( # ). You place the same number of hash marks as the size of the header you want. There are 6 header sizes:

# Header One
## Header Two
### Header Three
#### Header Four
##### Header Five
###### Header Six

You can't really make a header bold, but you can italicize certain words:

#### This is a header _four_

## Links
There are two different link types in Markdown, but both of them render the exact same way.

The first link type is called an _inline link_. To create an inline link, you wrap the link text in brackets ( [ ] ), and then you wrap the link in parenthesis ( ( ) ):

Let's [google it](www.google.com).

You can also add emphasis to link texts:

Let's [**really** google it](www.google.com).

You can make links within headings, too:

#### The Latest News from [Google](www.google.com).

The second link type is called a _reference link_, it is actually a reference to another place in the document:

How do I [find][google] information on the Internet?

[google]: www.google.com
